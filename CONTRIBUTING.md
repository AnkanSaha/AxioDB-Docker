# Contributing to AxioDB Docker

Welcome to **AxioDB Docker**! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to this containerized extension of AxioDB. By contributing, you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a collaborative and respectful environment.

## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please take the time to read the [README.md](README.md) file to get an understanding of the project's goals, architecture, and functionality. This Docker implementation exposes AxioDB through multiple protocols, so familiarity with Docker, networking, and various communication protocols is helpful.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository. Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This creates your own copy of the repository, where you can make changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Once your fork is created, clone it to your local development environment using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/axiodb-docker.git
cd axiodb-docker
```

### 3. Set Up the Development Environment

To contribute effectively, you'll need:

- Docker installed on your development machine
- Node.js for testing and development
- Familiarity with the protocols supported (REST, TCP, WebSocket, GRPC, UDP)

### 4. Creating a Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Making Changes

When working on AxioDB Docker, consider these guidelines:

- **Docker Image Improvements:** Optimize the Dockerfile for better performance, security, or smaller image size.
- **Protocol Implementations:** Enhance existing protocols or add new communication methods.
- **Documentation:** Update or expand documentation for better clarity.
- **Testing:** Create or improve tests for reliability.

### 6. Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your changes, ensure they work as expected:

```bash
# Build your Docker image locally
docker build -t axiodb-test .

# Run the container
docker run -d --name axiodb-test -p 27018-27023:27018-27023 axiodb-test

# Test the functionality you've modified
```

### 7. Submitting a Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your changes:

1. Push your branch to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Go to the original AxioDB Docker repository and create a Pull Request.
3. Provide a clear description of the changes and reference any related issues.
4. Wait for the maintainers to review your Pull Request. They may ask for changes or clarification.

## Docker-Specific Contribution Areas

We particularly welcome contributions in these areas:

- Optimizing the Docker image build process
- Improving security of the containerized application
- Adding support for additional protocols or integration methods
- Enhancing configuration options via environment variables
- Creating comprehensive examples for different integration scenarios
- Improving documentation for container deployment in various environments

Thank you for contributing to AxioDB Docker!
